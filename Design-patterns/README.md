# Design-patterns

===========-----------===========-----------===========-----------===========-----------===========

Some of software design patters I know. In some cases I tried to slightly improve those patterns without affecting the purpose of their existence, sometimes it didn't really work so I coded standard version. 

My examples of those patterns may be in some cases not really advanced, or on the contrary, consist of too much code for such a simple pattern. Single example is not showing my abilities to use design patterns, of course this code somehow shows how I understand this patterns, but You can't rate a player after just one game. I've tried here to show structure and purpose of these patterns, how did it go You can see within the code. Some of the patterns are really special, unique and advanced, some are clear, easy to understand and to keep in mind. For some of them you can't clearly see the context of use at first sight, for the others You can see it almost immediately.

A thing worth to note is that some of the patterns are really really simillar to each other. Like "strategy" and "bridge", here the things are getting complicated.
